## Introduction - EnviroPOS
This repository contains all the required files to compile the PAT. The PAT is based on the provided [topic](#topic) and is complete with comments, custom functions and procedures, a database, class files, text files for importing/exporting, a help 'website' (.html files), appropriate hints, and more.

This project consists of 11 forms:

 1. Authentication Form: Complete with a beautiful, simplistic GUI where users will log in to the program.
 2. Registration Form: Where users will register as a *cashier* or a *supplier*. (Managers are registered on the first run of the program.)
 3. Authentication-help Form: **2FA**[^1] for suppliers/managers. Used to provide help setting up 2FA (QR code [^2]), which is done with a beautiful GUI and fluent instructions.
 4. EnviroPOS Main Form: This form serves as a gateway to the other functions of the POS software, and shows basic stats at a glance to the user.
 5. New Order Form: Form where cashiers start an order for a customer. Features order exporting through **emailing** directly to the customer and utilises OOP and a class to manage the order.
 6. Dialog Form: This custom dialog form allows the user to choose between adding or managing a customer.
 7. Customer Management Form: Customer details and all their orders and the order-specific details can be seen here.
 8. Add Customer Form: A cashier can add a customer to the database here.
 9. Inventory Management Form: Items can be added to the database by suppliers, and their details can be modified here too.
 10. Admin Centre: Grants the manager (administrator) direct access to the database.
 11. Help Browser: Loads the help documentation html file. 

## Topic

<ins>***Save our Planet***</ins> [^3]

Our environment is constantly changing, and there is a need to become increasingly aware of the
environmental issues that are causing these changes. Environmental issues are defined as
harmful effects to the Earth and its natural systems due to the actions of humans.

There is a massive increase in natural disasters related to global warming which affect weather
patterns, and people need to be a lot more cautious in the way they lead their lives in conjunction
with the types of environmental issues our planet is facing. 

The responsibility lies with mankind to take on the initiative to do more to protect and save our
planet.

Projects in the scenario above could include the following topics related to addressing
environmental issues towards saving our planet:
1. A system to manage fund-raising projects on saving/protecting endangered animals, such as
rhinos, whales, etc./information system providing information on endangered species
2. A system to manage voluntary projects/activities related to the environments, such as beach
and park clean-ups
3. A system to manage the reduction, reuse and recycling of materials such as glass, plastic,
paper or other products
4. An online store for the sale of environmentally friendly/energy-efficient/eco-friendly products,
e.g. LED lights and solar panels
5. A system to manage workshops/educational programmes to mobilise/encourage actions to
address environmental issues. Activities/Programmes may include planting trees, saving
water and electricity, the reduction of waste materials, ways of producing eco-friendly
food/other products.
6. A system to provide information on types of electrical vehicles, bicycles and other ways of
promoting the use of alternative energy sources for transport
7. A system to keep track of/provide information on aspects related to climate change, such as
changes in weather patterns/occurrences of natural disasters, etc.
8. A system to manage data on blogs/forums/social media/magazines related to environmental
issues and/or weather/climate-related issues
9. A system to provide information on the levels/affects/activities leading to
air/water/plastic/other forms of pollution in the world/countries/regions
10. A system for solid-waste management which entails the storage, collection, transfer and
transport, processing and disposal of solid waste in such a manner that it does not have a
harmful effect on the environment

**NOTE:** The system does not have to be executed online.

Choose an application related to saving our planet and do research on the information system
requirements.

You are not limited to the list of ideas above, but you need to keep within the overall theme â€“ Save
our planet.

Note that you need to choose data and functionalities (services) in such a way as to develop a
well-rounded application related to the topic.

**NOTE**: Your final program must comprise ***one*** single project with logically related parts.

## Usage
This project can be compiled and run through the Delphi IDE (RAD Studio). The executable file will be saved under `/Win32/Debug` in the project folder, which can then be distributed.  
Note that this project was created using *Rad Studio 11*, and might not compile in older versions of Rad Studio.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** For this PAT to compile, _**YOU MUST INSTALL `SVGIconImageList` AS A GetIt PACKAGE!**_
